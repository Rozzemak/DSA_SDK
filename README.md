# DSA_SDK
This is unmodified deadline PGL2 release commit from my local repo. 
Same project image can be found on my public onedrive page.

## Introduction
This project will be covering all Algorithm, which are 
essentials parts of DSA course.
Another interesting part is my graph therorem tree implementation
and "wpf rendering" of it.
Also, you will find here many essential parts from PGL2
course (Which will not be shown in any UML).

I wont borther you with additional details, so here is 
a list of things you can find here:
* Advanced OOP
* MVC architecture
* Generics
* Parallel programming => Threads, delegates, async waiting
* Some design patterns covered by PGL2 course.
* UML diagram https://i.imgur.com/IuidOJG.png
* File generation, based on text format, and type. (UTF-8,16..). (Formats will come..)
* And of course, some basic implementation of many sorts.

## Current Usage

You are currently able to create a file, filled with set format and char type.
Sort it, and see stylish debug console while doing it.
Also, you are able to see my implementation of mentioned N-ary trees 
from graph theorem course. (Not finished)

# DSA_SDK
This is unmodified initial commit from my local repo. 
Same project image can be found on my public onedrive page.

## Introduction
This project will be covering all Algorithm, which are 
essentials parts of DSA course.
Also, you will find here many essential parts from PGL2
cource.

I wont borther you with additional details, so here is 
a list of things you can find here:
* Advanced OOP
* MVC architecture
* Generics
* Parallel programming => Threads, delegates, async waiting
* Some design patterns covered by PGL2 course.
* UML diagram (Link will be here, when the time comes..)
* File generation, based on text format, and type. (UTF-8,16..).
* And of course, some basic implementation of many sorts.

## Current Usage

You are currently able to create a file, filled with set format and char type.
Sort it, and see stylish debug console while doing it.
